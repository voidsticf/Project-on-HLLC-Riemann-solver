# Project on HLLC Riemann solver

During my participation in the Computational Astrophysics course at the University of Copenhagen, I developed a mini-project focusing on the HLLC Riemann solver. In this project, I compared the performance of the HLL and LLF Riemann solvers with the HLLC solver by implementing two test shock tube problems. Additionally, I extended the solver to two dimensions and applied it to simulate a blast wave scenario. The results from the 2D case were also compared with the HLL solver. A detailed theoretical analysis and presentation of the results can be found in the accompanying report (report.pdf).
